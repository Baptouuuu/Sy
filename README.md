Sy Javascript Framework
=======================

## Philosophy

The aim of this framework is to help you build Single-Page Application (SPA). Sy is built around three principles:

- **Fully asynchronous**
- **Zero closures**
- **Building apps not websites**

## Project state

Sy is currently in the phase of finding the right structure for the app. So nothing's ready to be used, yet!

## Conventions

### Naming

To declare namespaces, use the `UpperCamelCase` syntax, examples:

- `App.Bundle.Foo.Controller.Bar`
- `App.Bundle.Foo.Entity.Baz`

A "class" naming also use `UpperCamelCase`.

An "instance" or any variables is declared using `lowerCamelCase`

### Contributing

Sy framework uses [gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), so any pull request have to be made into develop.

Before submitting new issues, make sure no one already opened a discussion in the [tracker](https://github.com/baptouuuu/sy/issues) related to yours.

Please follow the coding style explained above.
