# Training wheels off

Yes the app is not complete, but a good way to learn something new is to go play around. The previous chapters were an introduction to how to start building an app. But you have everything you need to complete this app now.

To recap a bit, there's still 3 features to do:

* editing a profile
* deleting a profile
* searching the contacts

For the first one you almost already have what you need via the create controller. For the rest, go read the documentation and the book if it's not already done.

**Note**: also take a look at the validation system to learn how to leverage its power to validate your entity via the form engine.

If you're stuck, go take a look at the working [code](../../tutorial). If you're really stuck, feel free to open a new [issue](https://github.com/Baptouuuu/Sy/issues/new) to ask your question(s).
